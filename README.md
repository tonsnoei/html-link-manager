### Development Process

The entire application was built using:
- **Aider**: Connected to OpenRouter for seamless AI-powered coding
- **OpenRouter API**: Providing access to the DeepSeek-R1 free model
- **Time Investment**: 5-10 minutes of active development spread over an hour
- **Cost**: $0.00 (completely free using the DeepSeek-R1 free tier)
